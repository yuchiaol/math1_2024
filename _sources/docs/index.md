## Course description
This course gives students an overview of first and second order linear ordinary differential equations (OEDs) and linear algebra. Basic numerical methods for solving ODEs will also be introduced. These math skills will be applied to atmospheric sciences problems.

## Class schedule

### First-order ODEs:
- <span style="color:red">Week1 (9/2 & 9/4)</span>: responses to (complex) exponential, oscillating inputs
- <span style="color:red">Week2 (9/9 & 9/11)</span>: responses to delta and step function inputs, integrating factor
- <span style="color:red">Week3 (9/16 & 9/18)</span>: separable euqations and exact solution, phase line

### Second-order ODEs:
- <span style="color:red">Week4 (9/23 & 9/25)</span>: fundamental equation of mechanics, forced harmonic motion and unforced damped motion
